# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: Fix friends panel friend request system and game invitations multiplayer system in wonder-game-hub. 
  Use-case 1: Friends can send friend requests, see notifications with badge counts, accept/decline requests, and see friends in their list after acceptance. Both users should get notifications.
  Use-case 2: Users can invite friends/online users to games, send game invitations as notifications, join game rooms, have room owners control access, share room codes for manual entry, and always have AI as 4th player.

  - task: "Friends system - database operations"

        -working: true
        -agent: "testing"
        -comment: "✅ TESTED AND WORKING: All core friends management functions are working properly. send_friend_request creates friend requests successfully, accept_friend_request and decline_friend_request work correctly, list_friends returns accepted friends, get_friend_requests fetches pending requests, and search_children searches for users. Database operations and foreign key relationships are functioning correctly."

        -comment: "❌ PARTIALLY WORKING: Core room functions work (create_room ✅, join_room ✅, invite_friends ✅, request_to_join ✅) with proper AI player integration. However, CRITICAL ISSUES: 1) get_pending_invitations fails with database schema error 'Could not find a relationship between join_requests and game_rooms in the schema cache' 2) handle_join_request has parsing issues. These prevent the invitation workflow from completing properly."

The foreign key constraint 'join_requests_room_id_fkey' between join_requests.room_id and game_rooms.id is missing from the database schema. This prevents get_pending_invitations from working and blocks the entire invitation workflow. All 3 reported fixes (database schema, parsing, invitation workflow) are NOT working. The code changes were made but the underlying database schema relationship is still missing."

The relationship error 'Could not find a relationship between join_requests and game_rooms in the schema cache' STILL OCCURS despite manual join code being implemented. Root cause analysis: 1) The error occurs before manual join code executes, suggesting Supabase schema cache issue 2) Migration file exists (20250129000000_fix_join_requests_game_rooms_relationship.sql) but may not be applied 3) Schema cache needs reload via 'NOTIFY pgrst, reload schema' but cannot execute due to auth restrictions. CRITICAL: The manual join workaround is correctly implemented in code but Supabase function deployment or schema cache prevents it from working."
